						<br>In 1953, a group of male college students in the Zeta Kappa Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega National Service Fraternity at Bowling Green State University decided they needed another organization to help them with projects on campus and in the city of Bowling Green, Ohio. The original thought was to establish another service fraternity at the university; however, after a number of women expressed interest, plans were made to organize a women’s service sorority instead. Since the two organizations shared the same objective of developing friendships and performing service, a similar name was chosen: Omega Phi Alpha.

							<p><br>Omega Phi Alpha was founded on June 15, 1967, at Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio. It now includes thousands of women in 31 collegiate chapters nationwide. It is an organization built by and for real, strong women who actively serve their communities. OPA sisters strive to further the sorority’s principles of friendship, leadership, and service. As alumnae, members can become lifelong, service-minded leaders.<br>

							<p><br>The Omega Chapter was founded at Rutgers University in 2000 and re-chartered on February 28, 2015, by our founding mothers (pictured right).
								Omega Phi Alpha is an associate of the <a href="http://www.rutgersphc.com" target="_blank">Panhellenic Council</a> at Rutgers University.
								We do not participate in Rutgers's Formal Recruitment and Omega Phi Alpha is not a member of the National Panhellenic Conference.
							<br> <br>
							Thanks to our founding mothers' vision for the Omega Chapter and our passion for service, OPhiA is a 3-star sorority on campus and recipient of several awards including Outstanding Chapter President, Pillars Award, DM Spirit in Service, Programming Achievement Award and many more!</p>

							&emsp; Hello! On behalf of the sisters of the Omega Chapter of Omega Phi Alpha at Rutgers University, I want to welcome you to our site! Thank you for taking the time to visit and learn about our sisterhood. It is an honor and a privilege to represent such an incredible group of women, and I hope that while you are here, you can see why. <br>
							&emsp; Omega Phi Alpha is a sorority founded on the principles of friendship, leadership, and service. These values guide our sisters in everything we do, both on and off campus. Our sisters are active leaders on campus, they are academically successful, and they have a passion for giving back.<br>
							&emsp;I joined Omega Phi Alpha during my freshman year when I was just a shy and nervous out-of-state student. I was searching for a way to do what I was passionate about, helping others, but also be able to do it with others. Omega Phi Alpha gave me the opportunity to do all of this and more. Throughout my years here, I have had the opportunity to develop into a confident leader and have a support system like no other. Being a sister is joining a lifelong sisterhood that bigger than yourself, and learning the power of service. Through Omega Phi Alpha I was able to do the things I loved doing while also finding a home away from home.  <br>
							&emsp; I hope I will see you at our recruitment events! If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me!<br>
